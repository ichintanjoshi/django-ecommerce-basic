-This is sparta
- Start using pycharm for the project
- The idea is as following:
    - To make a basic e-comm site
    - Site should have following pages
    1- /home
        - This page should contain the products display.
        - Following are the things to be included in the product display.
            - Product image (should be zoomable when mouse is on the image like flipkart)
            - Product details:
                - Product name
                - Product Price
            - Buy Button
            - Show details button
    2 - /product/{product-id}
        - When user clicks on product's Show details button they should be able to see the product's details
        - That should contain in-depth details of the product (visit flipkart for the same)
        - Should have add to cart button
    3 - /cart
        - Should show the details of the products added in the cart
        - Should have following buttons with product details
            - Remove from cart
            - Checkout
        - Should have a button which checks out all the products
    4 - /orders
        - Details of the orders placed
    5 - /login
        - A Page for login
    6 - /register
        - A page for registration to your site
        - Should contain all the fields leggit to registration
        - That should be validated
        - Add google's "I am not a robot" verification for the same


- To add this:
    git clone https://github.com/ichintanjoshi/django-ecommerce-basic.git
- After you have made your project or any of it's files in this directory run following commands
    - git add your_file
    - git commit -m "[ADD]: your adding message"
                    "[FIX]: for fixing any bugs"
    - git push origin master

- Or you could simply user smart git software :p
